    - Corey I need you to look into setting up an efficent way to incorporate
      the member's personal pages into our website. How will we maintain the source

      out best approach for this part of this project.

Vice President:
    - I will need to look into how we can publish this website under the UW domain and 
      need to look into the data side of the website (SQL).
    - Also, please push requests to the repository for everyone else to see the changes
      prior to just accepting the changes automatically on your own.

President:
    - We need you to make sure we aren't doing anything that is in violation of UW policy
      or general organization policy all together. 
    - Need help with general design and coloring of the website.
